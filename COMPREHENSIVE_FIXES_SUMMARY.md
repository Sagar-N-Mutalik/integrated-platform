## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Registration Issue - FIXED

**Problem**: Signup form wasn't working because it was using `FormData` instead of controlled state.

**Solution**:
- Converted all form inputs to controlled components
- Fixed state management in Signup.js
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Fixed password validation
- Fixed gender radio buttons
- Fixed date of birth input

**Files Modified**:
- `minor-project-frontend/src/components/Signup.js`
- `minor-project-frontend/src/App.js`

**Result**: Registration now works perfectly! ✅

### 2. ✅ FileManager Bug - FIXED

**Problem**: Undefined variable `k` in formatFileSize function

**Solution**: Added `const k = 1024;` to properly define the variable

**File Modified**: `minor-project-frontend/src/components/FileManager.js`

**Result**: File size formatting works without crashing! ✅

---

### 3. ✅ Environment Configuration - CREATED

**Created Files**:
1. `minor-project-frontend/.env` - Frontend environment variables
2. Updated `.gitignore` files to exclude sensitive data

**Environment Variables Added**:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dy5wk8uup
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=health_records
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

**Result**: Cloudinary configuration ready! ✅

---

### 4. ✅ .gitignore Updated

**Files Modified**:
- `minor-project-frontend/.gitignore`
- `MinorProjectBackend/.gitignore` (already had .env excluded)

**Added to .gitignore**:
- `.env` files
- IDE folders (.idea/, .vscode/)
- Temporary files

**Result**: Sensitive data protected! ✅
