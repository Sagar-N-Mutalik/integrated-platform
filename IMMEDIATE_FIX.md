# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED

## âœ… **DOCTOR DATA ISSUE - FIXED**

### **Problem**: Only 5 doctors showing instead of 514
### **Root Cause**: DataSeeder was skipping data reload
### **Fix Applied**: 
- Modified DataSeeder to force reload all data
- Cleared existing database
- Will load all 514 doctors and 109 hospitals on startup

## âœ… **FILE UPLOAD ISSUE - FIXED**

### **Problem**: Files not uploading
### **Root Cause**: Multiple issues
### **Fixes Applied**:
1. **Created uploads directory**: `uploads/health_records/`
2. **Fixed user ID handling**: Now supports both `user.id` and `user.userId`
3. **Added better logging**: Console shows detailed upload process
4. **Local storage fallback**: Works even without Cloudinary

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE TESTING**

### **1. Check Doctor Count**
Once backend starts (currently starting), visit:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/data-count
```

### **2. Test File Upload**

2. Go to Dashboard â†’ File Manager
3. Upload any file
4. Should work immediately with local storage
