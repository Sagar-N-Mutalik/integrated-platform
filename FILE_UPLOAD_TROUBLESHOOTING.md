# 🔧 File Upload Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 "Internal Server Error" Fix

Your file upload system now has **automatic fallback** to local storage if Cloudinary fails.

### ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED**

1. **Local Storage Fallback** - Files will be stored locally if Cloudinary fails
2. **Better Error Handling** - Detailed error messages in console
3. **File Size Validation** - 50MB limit with clear error messages
4. **Automatic Detection** - System detects if Cloudinary is configured properly

### 🔍 **How It Works Now**

```
File Upload Request
       ↓
   Validate File (size, empty check)
       ↓
   Try Cloudinary Upload
       ↓
   ❌ Cloudinary Fails?
       ↓
   ✅ Fallback to Local Storage
       ↓
   File Saved Successfully!
```

### 📁 **Local Storage Details**

- **Storage Location**: `uploads/health_records/{userId}/`
- **File Access**: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/files/download/{userId}/{filename}`
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Delete operations work for both Cloudinary and local files

### 🔧 **To Use Cloudinary (Optional)**

If you want to use Cloudinary instead of local storage:

1. **Get Cloudinary Account** (free tier available)
2. **Update application.yml**:
```yaml
cloudinary:
  cloud-name: your_actual_cloud_name
  api-key: your_actual_api_key
  api-secret: your_actual_api_secret
```

### 🧪 **Test Your Fix**

1. **Start Backend**: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`
2. **Start Frontend**: `npm start`
3. **Upload Any File** - Should work immediately!
4. **Check Console** - You'll see detailed logs

### 📊 **Console Output Examples**
