# ✅ Final Fixes Applied - Doctors & Hospitals Search

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: 🎉 ALL ISSUES FIXED!

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Endpoint Paths - FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend was calling wrong endpoints
- Was calling: `/api/v1/doctors` and `/api/v1/hospitals`
- Should be: `/api/v1/search/doctors` and `/api/v1/search/hospitals`

**Solution**: Updated all API calls in DoctorSearch.js and HospitalDirectory.js

---

### 2. ✅ Field Name Mismatches - FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend was using wrong field names from API response

**Hospital Model Fields (Actual)**:
- `hospitalName` (not `name`)
- `hospitalType` (not `c` or `type`)
- `location` (not `address`)
- `phone` (not `phone1`)
- `altPhone` (not `phone2`)
- `contact` (not `email`)
- `specialties` (array)
- `description`

**Solution**: Updated all field references in both components

---

- Modern card-based design
- Smooth animations
